# Sybil System

The Sybil System main goals are :
- Manage crime and violence
- Manage work, and career evolution

it is extremely inspired by Sybil from psychopass

### How it works

every X ticks (yet to be determined) the system will iterate over 
all the NPC to adjust the environmental traits according to local 
and global events / social environment evolution

every X ticks (yet to be determined) and at each age milestone 
(child to teenager, teenager to adult) it will update career path and 
interests of all the NPC
